# Hi, Iâ€™m MrPeanutbutterz

I'm a student at Novi University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht, currently enrolled in the Fullstack Developer HBO program. My passion lies in the creative process of coding, where I find joy in bringing ideas to life through lines of code. I'm excited to be on this journey of learning and exploration, and I look forward to sharing and growing together with the vibrant community here.
